# Hardware Implementation

### Open Project
* Download the github project in the local repository.
* Open the project. The project name ends with (.prj). 
 ![open_project](./Hw_Implementation_Docs/open_project.png)
* The project has different solutions. Each solution has unique target device, clock period, cosimultation settings, and configuration settings.
 ![solution_names](./Hw_Implementation_Docs/solution_names.png)
* For all the solutions, the top module is same. Change or view the top module from, project -> project settings -> synthesis.

### C-Simulation 
* The C-simulation is common for all the solution. Run the C-simulation: Project -> Run C Simulation.
 ![simulation](./Hw_Implementation_Docs/simulation.png)
* We run the C-simulation with debug mode. Simulation does not work on normal mode. Hence, make sure "Launch Debugger" is ticked.
* In the debug mode, run the "Resume(F8)" to start the simulation. If the program works successfully, console shows "Known Answer test PASSED."
